HyperChoose
===========
a XMonad.Layout.Choose replacement (or companion)


usage sample:
add import somwhere in the begining of your xmonad.hs:
    import XMonad.Layout.HyperChoose

modify your layoutHook:
    layoutHints $ smartBorders $ hyperChoose (Full ||| Mirror tiled) $ hyperChoose (Grid ||| Circle) Roledex

add key binding:
    ((modMask              , xK_b     ), sendMessage NextLayout')

now you can switch between 3 different groups of layouts.

Other Messages
==============
`FirstLayout'` - jumps to the first layout
`JumpToLayout "LayoutName"` - jumps to the first layout with such description

Labels
======
In some cases default descriptions is just not good enough, thus you can use `XMonad.Layout.HyperChoose.Label` to assign descriptions directly.
For example:
    myLayout = layoutHints $ smartBorders $
        hyperChoose (Label "Full & Mirror" $ Full ||| Mirror tiled) $
            hyperChoose (Label "Grid & Circle" $ Grid ||| Circle) (Label "Third Layout" Roledex)

now you can switch to grid & circle layout by issuing `JumpToLayout "Grid & Circle"` message. no matter which of them is active.
